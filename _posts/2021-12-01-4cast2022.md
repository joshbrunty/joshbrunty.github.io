## Introduction

Since Forensic 4:Cast has now opened up their nominations early, I wanted to go ahead and post my own nominations for calendar year 2021. I'll also be sharing these to Twitter throughout the month of December as well (see below):

## DFIR Commercial Tool of the Year
### Magnet Axiom

Not only did Magnet close a [$115 million dollar initial public offering earlier this year](https://investors.magnetforensics.com/news/news-details/2021/Magnet-Forensics-Closes-115-Million-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx), but they also added a great deal of features to their already impressive Magnet Axiom suite of tools.
