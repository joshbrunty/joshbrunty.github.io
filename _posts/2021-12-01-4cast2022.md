## Introduction

Since Forensic 4:Cast has now opened up their nominations early, I wanted to go ahead and post my own nominations for calendar year 2021. I'll also be sharing these to Twitter throughout the month of December as well (see below):

Nominations can be placed by clicking [HERE](https://forms.gle/HtTr5SBcMv1oAZkh9). Nominations close May 1st, 2022 so be sure to get your nominations in before then! 

## DFIR Commercial Tool of the Year
### [Magnet Axiom](https://www.magnetforensics.com/products/magnet-axiom/)

Not only did Magnet close a [$115 million dollar initial public offering earlier this year](https://investors.magnetforensics.com/news/news-details/2021/Magnet-Forensics-Closes-115-Million-Initial-Public-Offering/default.aspx), but they also added a great deal of features to their already impressive Magnet Axiom suite of tools. In addition to their acquisition of [DME Forensics](https://dmeforensics.com/) & their software tool [DVR Examiner](https://dmeforensics.com/dvr-examiner/) and you have a strong suite of commerical tools under the Magnet Axiom umbrella. Add in a great group of people behind the software behind this tool it's pretty much an easy decision here.

## DFIR Non-Commercial Tool of the Year
### [xLEAPP](https://github.com/abrignoni)

If you're doing mobile forensics and haven't downloaded & utilized [Alexis Brignoni's](https://twitter.com/AlexisBrignoni) xLEAPP parsers stop what you are doing, download, and give it a spin. Brig's (along with a host of great community contributors), is constantly updating and adding new features to this tool. xLEAPP includes parsers for [iOS](https://github.com/abrignoni/iLEAPP), [Android](https://github.com/abrignoni/ALEAPP), [return logs](https://github.com/abrignoni/RLEAPP), and even [vehicles](https://github.com/abrignoni/VLEAPP)! In addition to the scripts/parsers being customizable due to their open-sourcing, and Brigs just being an all-around great guy makes xLEAPP worthy of a nomination.

## DFIR Show of the Year
### [DFIR.science](https://dfir.science/)

[Joshua James](https://twitter.com/DFIRScience) has been working tirelessly to publish videos and other content that benefits both seasoned and newbie examiners. His short, yet infomrative videos are nice little refreshers on tools, techniques, and software that you might not have known about and/or put on the back shelf for quite a while. I know personally I've learned a lot from the videos, so I encourage you to take advantage of this resource as well. This was an easy nomination for me.
