## **Introduction**

***"Does anyone know how I can generate an index of files in a directory to include in my case report to a client?"*** -Literally all of us at some point

I've seen this question popup dozens of times on DFIR listservs (and even on DFIR Discord) over the past 16 years I've been in this field. Many have offered up some open-source options like [dirhtml](https://www.portablefreeware.com/index.php?id=308) & [SnapHTML](https://www.rlvision.com/snap2html/about.php), both of which will do the job. But, as you can see these programs are either Windows-centric, non-customizable, brands your html file with their toolmark, and the source-code is not available. For these reasons alone I have tended to gravitate away from these tools in my own cases and case reports. I've also seen others suggest various python and bash scripts out there, but they either don't link to the script or just half-heartedly suggest ***"well you can build your own bash or python script."*** As any busy DFIR analyst would say ***"aint nobody got time for that!"***

Years ago, while still an analyst in the digital forensics laboratory, I had picked up this project with every intention to knock this out in a tidy little Python script once and for all. [Chris Vance](https://blog.d204n6.com/) had built some cool html templates that were used in our reports, but they focused more on harmonizing our tool reports with our case reports. We used the life out of them and, to my knowledge, the lab still uses them to this day. Life and work happens and wouldn't you know it got put on the back burner (along with my other DFIR projects). This past summer I [contributed to](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10961378/how-to-generate-an-html-directory-list-using-python/68535211#68535211) and did a little bit more tinkering with it, but didn't feel it to be ready to fully there just yet.

A few weeks ago, someone posted to the [Forensic Video Analysis (FVA) listserve](https://lists.fva-list.com/mailman/listinfo/fva-list) (which I highly recommend joining if you are eligible) asking the very question of locating a resource to generate such an index.html for their case report. This prompted me to sit down into the developer chair and polish something up to get out to the community... After some coding and tweaking, I came up with something....

## **Indexer.py**

#### [https://github.com/joshbrunty/Indexer](https://github.com/joshbrunty/Indexer)

[Indexer.py](https://github.com/joshbrunty/Indexer) is quite simple in theory. Indexer is a Python script that generates an .html index of files within a selected directory. You can start from the current directory or from folder passed as first positional argument. Optionally filter by file types with --filter "\*.py". This script is an hodgepodge of older scripts [collected & built](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10961378/how-to-generate-an-html-directory-list-using-python/68535211#68535211) over the years. This script requires you to have **[Python > 3.x.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)** installed on your system. Ideally, though, you'd want to use the current build of **[Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)** (significantly faster processing on larger directories!🏃). You can create a custom output file if you wish (*by default *index.html* is generated*). You can also match/filter specified parameters using [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) (i.e. by setting *'\**/*.jpg' & '\**/*.UFD'* parameters). File Size & Modified Time is also displayed for each file (although you can but that our of the provided .py script if you don't want that in there).

## **Usage**

Usage is pretty easy. As long as you have Python3 installed on Windows, Linux, or Mac you just simply download the script and run the following:

```python3 indexer.py /top_dir```

## **Positional arguments:**
As outlined above, top_dir was specified, although you can specify any working directory you wish. However, if you don't include this or choose not to the current working directory is used:

* ```top_dir```: top folder from which to start generating indexes (*uses current working directory/folder if not specified*).

## Optional arguments:
Here are other optional arguments that you can utlize within [Indexer.py](https://github.com/joshbrunty/Indexer):
* ```-h, --help```: show this help message and exit.
* ```-f, --filter```: only include files matching [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) (i.e.```indexer.py --filter '\**/*.jpg'*```).
* ```-o filename, --output-file filename```: Custom output file (by default generates "index.html")
* ```-r, --recursive```: recursively process nested folders/directories (*Off/False by default*).
* ```-v, --verbose```: verbosely list every processed file. (*NOTE: will take longer time with complex file tree structures on slow terminals.*)

## **Conclusion**
Short, sweet, open-source, and easy to use and customize. Feel free to pull it down and give it a shot. Also, feel free to contribute to it as well. This script doesn't belong to me nor do I want it to. This belongs to the DFIR community as a whole. Enjoy!
